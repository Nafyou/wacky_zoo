    Kangaroo's are intricate animals native to the outback's of Australia. The Kangaroo shown above, Roger, is an absolute unit of a Kangaroo. He hits the gym every day to survive the harsh wilderness of Australia. Little does he know, he is not in Australia, but rather, a digital simulation: Nafew's zoo. He is cared for and loved in his new digital home, but nevertheless he is diligent. Prepared to take on whatever threats may arrive.
