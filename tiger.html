      Nafew's zoo is home to many large cats, partcularly a subspecies of orange tabbies commonly referred to as <italic>Tigers</italic>. The tiger pictured above is known as Sam. Once they were our fiercest predators, but after being shown some true love and affection at Nafew's zoo, they have the behavior of cute, camera shy house cats. How wonderful !
